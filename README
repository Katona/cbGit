1. Overview

cbGit is going to be a simple Git plugin for the Code::Blocks IDE. I started it
to practice C++, Code:Blocks and Git. Since all these things are quite new for
me, it may took a while to create a usable and stable tool.

2. Compile

The plugin is being developed with Code::Blocks itself under Linux. The
repository contains the whole project, no Makefile has been created yet for the
compilation.

3. Additional information

The plugin is being developed on Linux, I have not tried to compile it on other
OS, it may compile but probably it wouldn't work. There is no dependency on
other libraries, but Git must be installed for the plugin to work.
